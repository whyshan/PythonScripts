A SMART BLONDE
A Blonde walks into a bank in New York City and asks for the loan officer. 
She says she's going to Europe on business for two weeks and needs to 
borrow $5,000. The bank officer says the bank will need some kind of 
security for such a loan, so the Blonde hands over the keys to a new Rolls 
Royce parked on the street in front of the bank Everything checks out, and 
the bank agrees to accept the car as collateral for the loan. An employee 
drives the Rolls into the bank's underground garage and parks it there. Two 
weeks later, the Blonde returns, repays the $5,000 and the interest, which 
comes to $15.41. The loan officer says, "We are very happy to have had your 
business, and this transaction has worked out very nicely, but we are a 
little puzzled. While you were away, we checked you out and found that you 
are a multimillionaire. What puzzles us is why would you bother to borrow 
$5,000?" The Blonde replied, "Where else in New York can I park my car for 
two weeks for 15 bucks?"
FINALLY! A SMART BLONDE JOKE!!!!!
